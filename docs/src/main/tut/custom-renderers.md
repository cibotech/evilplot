# Custom Renderers

In the introduction to plotting with EvilPlot, we gave `ScatterPlot` `PointRenderer.colorByCategory` as an argument. We
also mentioned that there are several `PointRenderer`s available by default. If you took a look at the plot catalog, you
might have also seen that there were some other types of renderers, like `BoxRenderer`, `PathRenderer`, and
`BarRenderer` that we can use to customize the base plots.

All of these are `PlotElementRenderer`s, and you're not limited to the ones that EvilPlot provides. With a little bit of
understanding of the [Drawing API](drawing-api.html), implementing a renderer can be the easiest way to get a highly
custom plot. Let's look at the interface:

```scala
trait PlotElementRenderer[C] {
  def render(plot: Plot, extent: Extent, context: C): Drawable
}
```

All you have to do is define how a piece of data gets displayed as a `Drawable`, and you're done. When you call
`render()` on the `Plot` later on, it will call `render` on your `PlotElementRenderer` and pass through the appropriate
context. The question is: what are those three arguments, and what can you do with them?

1. The first one is straightforward, you've seen `Plot` all over the place already! When you define your `render`
method, you get a hook back into the plot, so you can get certain information out of it. For example, you might be
interested in applying the plot's `xtransform` or `ytransform` to some auxiliary data, and you can just pull that out:

    ```scala
    val xTransform: Double => Double = plot.xtransformer(plot, ...)
    ```

    <!--
      This is not correct, the second argument is actually a size relevant to the plot's construction (full plot size in the
      case of scatter, line plot, contour plot and bar size in the case of box plot and bar chart)
    -->
2. The data to screen transformation will be different depending on how big we want to make the plot when we render it.
That's why `render` also gets an `extent` argument. This is the real size of the plot once it's rendered. Keep in mind
that we're able to access that quantity here because renderers are _only_ called when we turn the `Plot` into a
`Drawable`, not when we construct the `Plot`.

    ```scala
    val xTransform: Double => Double = plot.ytransformer(plot, extent)
    ```

3. Finally, the context. The context is a value of type `C`. The best way to explain this parameter is probably to look
at the renderers you've already seen, and what their respective context type is:
+ `PointRenderer` is a `PlotElementRenderer[Int]`
+ `PathRenderer` is a `PlotElementRenderer[Seq[Point]]`
+ `BoxRenderer` is a `PlotElementRenderer[BoxPlotSummaryStatistics]`

`PointRenderer` uses its context as a way to index into another sequence of data (like a sequence of categories in the
`colorByCategory` renderer). `PathRenderer` gets as context all the points that are in a particular path.

Let's implement a few custom renderers as examples:

### Implementing "jitter"

You might be familiar with adding random "jitter" to points in a scatter plot from other plotting libraries. We can
implement that in EvilPlot as a custom point renderer. This adds a bit of jitter in the y dimension.

```scala
def jitter(range: Double)(implicit theme: Theme): PointRenderer = new PointRenderer {
  def render(plot: Plot, extent: Extent, context: Int): Drawable = {
    import scala.util.Random
    val yTransform = (y: Double) => plot.xtransform(plot, extent)(y) + plot.xbounds.min
    Disc.centered(theme.elements.pointSize)
      .transY(yTransform(range * Random.nextDouble() - .5))
  }
}
```

A plot using the default `PointRenderer` at left and the `jitter` renderer at right:
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6">

</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<img src="/evilplot/img/docs/custom-renderers/jitter.png" class="img-responsive">
</div>
</div>

### Coloring data using a function

Our `jitter` renderer didn't access the context during plot creation at all, which makes it somewhat uninteresting and
not illustrative of the power of what you can do with plot element renderers. Let's write one that does. Imagine you
need a renderer for a bar chart that colors the bar based on the value, say red for negative and blue for positive. This
will work for non-stacked bar charts:

```scala
def colorBy(fn: Double => Color): BarRenderer = new BarRenderer {
  def render(plot: Plot, extent: Extent, category: Bar): Drawable =
    Rect(extent) filled fn(category.values.head)
}
```

For a stacked bar chart, things might get a bit more complicated. But, we can use this and observe it in action.

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-6" markdown="1">
```scala
import com.cibo.evilplot.colors.HTMLNamedColors.{crimson, dodgerBlue}
val coloring: Double => Color = (d: Double) =>
  if (d <= 0) crimson else dodgerBlue
BarChart.custom(Seq(-15, 22, -5).map(Bar(_)), Some(colorBy(coloring)))
  .xAxis(Seq("one", "two", "three"))
  .yAxis()
  .hline(0)
  .frame()
  .render()
```
</div>
